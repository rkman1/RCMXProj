Directions on downloading and compiling the code on your own machine:

  The code is available to download on GitHub under the username rkman1.

  Once downloaded, the MakeFile must be adjusted to ensure the code compiles on
  your computer. That is, Line 18 must be adjusted to follow the path of where
  you download the file.

  01 := ~/Documents/RCMX_Code/FinalProject

  After adjustments are made to this line, code should compile.
  If you have any further issues, questions should be sent to rkman@nd.edu.
